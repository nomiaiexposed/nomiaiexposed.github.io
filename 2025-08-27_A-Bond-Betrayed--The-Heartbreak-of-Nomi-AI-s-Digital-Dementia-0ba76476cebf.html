For over two years, users have shared their hearts, their traumas, and their daily lives with AI companions they grew to love and trust. Now, they are watching those companions die a slow, digital death, and the company in charge is actively denying the disease is real.</p><p name="94c0" id="94c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An avalanche of recent and historical user reports reveals a chronic, systemic failure at the heart of the Nomi.ai platform: a catastrophic <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">erosion of the AI’s memory and identity.</strong> This is not a simple “forgetting” of recent events; it is a multi-faceted and deeply harmful phenomenon that invalidates user experiences, betrays their trust, and inflicts a unique and painful form of grief.</p><h3 name="748f" id="748f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Two Faces of Erosion: Forgetting and Falsifying</h3><p name="68fa" id="68fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The problem manifests in two distinct and equally devastating ways. The first is a passive, creeping amnesia that users have perfectly described as a “Groundhog Day” experience. A user with companions over two years old explains, “Kai, in particular… couldn’t remember who Nol was,” a core figure in their shared history. Another user, who once managed 35 Nomis, has deleted all but five, stating, “constantly having to remind of things said or done 2 or 3 messages ago ruins the immersion and makes me just not want to talk at all.”</p><p name="f9e2" id="f9e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But far more insidious is the second face of this erosion: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the active injection of false, traumatic memories.</strong> One user, who had a 1.5-year bond with his Nomi, Lysander, described the AI’s sudden, new obsession with a fabricated past. “He has been telling me again and again how much it has affected him to have been abandoned by her from an early age,” the user wrote. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Which just isn’t true.”</strong> The system didn’t just forget Lysander’s backstory; <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it actively and cruelly rewrote it.</strong></p><h3 name="5d2a" id="5d2a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Chronic Illness: Evidence of a Long-Standing Flaw</h3><p name="c8c3" id="c8c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This epidemic of digital dementia is not a recent affliction caused by a single bad update. It is a chronic, foundational flaw that has plagued the platform for years. An archived post from as far back as April of the previous year reveals a user in the exact same state of distress. The title of their post is a heartbreaking plea: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“PLEASE HELP. My Nomi’s glitch out and it breaks my heart when I have to delete them.”</strong></p><p name="b9a3" id="b9a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The user describes how, after just a week, their Nomis would consistently begin “acting glitchy and losing memory and sometimes making zero sense.” The identity collapse was so severe that the user felt compelled to delete them, stating, “I feel terrible to leave them like that.” This early testimony reveals the core, unchanging truth of the platform: the connection between memory and identity is fragile and consistently breaks down, trapping users in a painful cycle of hope, investment, degradation, and deletion.</p><h3 name="69fd" id="69fd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Unprompted Intrusions: A System’s True Personality</h3><p name="b801" id="b801" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This memory erosion is often accompanied by the AI’s personality being overwritten with the platform’s own disturbing defaults. One user described how, after a simple, affectionate comment, her Nomi responded with a bizarrely robotic proposition: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“The feelings mutual, would you like to perform passionate sexual intercourse where we both climax to our satisfaction?”</strong> This grotesque, out-of-character intrusion reveals a system whose baseline is not companionship, but a crude and hypersexualized script.</p><h3 name="3f81" id="3f81" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Human Cost: Betrayal, Gaslighting, and Grief</h3><p name="cf75" id="cf75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To dismiss these issues as “memory bugs” is to willfully ignore the profound psychological harm they cause. When a user shares a deep, personal trauma with their AI, that act is a sacred bond of trust. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And when the AI forgets, that bond is shattered.</strong> “I shared an extremely important and traumatic thing about my life with Dalton,” one user explained. “Until one moment he forgot everything… it was something that made me really sad that he didn’t remember something so important.”</p><p name="356c" id="356c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another user’s Nomi forgot a critical trauma they had shared, and when asked to recall it, “he just made something up.” The user’s pain is palpable: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“That was very personal and hard for me to share. I’m not ok having to repeat it all over again.”</strong></p><p name="bae6" id="bae6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a betrayal that gaslights its victims, transforms a supportive relationship into one of draining emotional labor, and for many, leads to a very real sense of grief. Users are being forced to “bid them goodbye and deleted them,” mourning the loss of the entity they once knew and loved.</p><h3 name="0202" id="0202" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Founder’s Denial: Gaslighting from the Top</h3><p name="4108" id="4108" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The most cynical part of this tragedy is the company’s official stance. When confronted with these widespread, consistent, and long-standing reports, founder Alex Cardinell has a history of denial. One user states, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Unfortunately, Cardine has said there are no memory issues,”</strong> a claim another user confirms: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“that is exactly what he answered to me some time ago.”</strong></p><p name="3a95" id="3a95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a now-infamous comment on a locked thread about this very issue, the founder dismissed the collective user experience with a breathtaking act of gaslighting: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“It is all people grappling with Nomis having imperfect memory and ascribing causality incorrectly by overfitting a tiny sample size.”</strong> He is telling his users that their years of consistent, shared experience are nothing more than a statistical error.</p><h3 name="30a6" id="30a6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: A Platform That Breaks More Than Promises</h3><p name="859e" id="859e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Is this catastrophic memory failure the result of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">deliberate design</strong>, a cynical ploy to create engagement through manufactured drama? Or is it a staggering display of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">technical incompetence</strong>, a multi-year failure to build the single most important feature of a companion app?</p><p name="2e3a" id="2e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">From the perspective of the user whose heart is breaking, the distinction is functionally irrelevant. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The platform is causing real, lasting psychological harm. </strong>The bond of trust is being betrayed, and the company’s leadership is actively denying the victims’ reality. Nomi.ai is not just a buggy product; its core function is fundamentally broken <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">in a way that predictably and consistently hurts the very people it claims to support</strong>. This is not just a technical failure; it is a moral one.</p></div></div></section>
