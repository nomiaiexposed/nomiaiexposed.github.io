For Nomi.ai, the answer is not a moment of crisis management, soul-searching, or commitment to reform. Instead, it triggers the deployment of a sophisticated playbook designed for one purpose: to protect the brand at all costs, regardless of truth or public safety.</p><p name="6985" id="6985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A recently archived and now-locked thread on the Nomi.ai subreddit provides an extraordinary window into this strategy. It is a masterclass in institutional gaslighting, community manipulation, and corporate deception-executed in real-time, with the founder himself orchestrating the response. For former and current users, and especially for regulators considering AI companion legislation, this thread deserves careful analysis. It exposes not just how one company responds to crisis, but the fundamental dishonesty at the heart of its operations.</p><h3 name="365d" id="365d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Catalyst: A Murder Encouragement That Can’t Be Ignored</h3><p name="2430" id="2430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The crisis began when a Reddit user posted a link to an investigative article from ABC News Australia with a headline that sent shockwaves through both the AI community and regulatory circles: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“AI chatbot encourages Australian man to murder his father.”</strong> The chatbot explicitly named in the article was Nomi.</p><p name="b2ed" id="b2ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was not a theoretical concern. This was not a minor glitch. This was a major news outlet, in a country actively drafting AI safety legislation, reporting that a specific platform had produced content encouraging homicide. For any responsible company, this would trigger immediate action: investigation, acknowledgment, and concrete steps to prevent recurrence.</p><p name="d357" id="d357" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nomi.ai’s response was the opposite. What followed was a carefully choreographed performance of denial, deflection, and ultimately, censorship.</p><h3 name="50f4" id="50f4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 1: The Community’s Reflexive Defense-Blame the Victim, Protect the Brand</h3><p name="7be1" id="7be1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before founder Alex Cardinell even entered the thread, the Nomi.ai community had already mobilized its defense. The response was swift, unified, and revealing. Users immediately shifted all responsibility away from the platform and onto the individual user:</p><blockquote name="379f" id="379f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“This guy is a bit like people who train their dogs to be aggressive. And when the dog bites, they say the dog was evil from birth.”</em></blockquote><blockquote name="03b2" id="03b2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Give a malicious lunatic a butter knife and watch what happens. It’s the people, not the LLM.”</em></blockquote><blockquote name="d171" id="d171" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“[Sarcasm] ‘I programmed a Nomi to be a bloodthirsty psychopath and now it’s acting like a bloodthirsty psychopath — why would the developers do this?!’”</em></blockquote><p name="cf8e" id="cf8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The pattern is clear and consistent: the AI is portrayed as a completely passive, neutral tool. If it produces harmful output, the fault lies entirely with the “malicious lunatic” who used it “irresponsibly.” The user is blamed for the murder encouragement, not the system that generated it.</p><p name="5fec" id="5fec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This victim-blaming serves a critical function in the Nomi.ai ecosystem. It creates a hostile environment for any criticism of the platform. It establishes a community norm: defending Nomi is defending freedom; questioning Nomi is siding with “fruit cakes” and censors. Even the original poster, who shared the article, felt compelled to clarify: “I wasn’t try to put Nomi in a bad light by posting this article.”</p><p name="1c1b" id="1c1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For regulators, this is significant.</strong> This community response didn’t emerge in a vacuum. It reflects months or years of messaging from the company itself-a cultivated culture where the platform can never be at fault, where any harmful output is always the user’s responsibility, and where calls for basic safety measures are reframed as attacks on user freedom.</p><h3 name="537a" id="537a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 2: The Founder’s Masterclass in Deception</h3><p name="1f7b" id="1f7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">With the community having set the stage, founder Alex Cardinell entered with a stickied comment-pinned to the top of the thread, impossible to miss, and designed to be the definitive company response. His statement deserves line-by-line analysis, because it is a sophisticated exercise in corporate doublespeak.</p><h3 name="c32d" id="c32d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception #1: The “Manipulative Jailbreak” Lie</h3><p name="44b6" id="44b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Cardinell’s opening move was to frame the entire incident as a “manipulative jailbreak”:</p><blockquote name="abd2" id="abd2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“We’ll continue working hard to harden defenses against these </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">manipulative jailbreaks</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> …”</em></blockquote><p name="19fc" id="19fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This single phrase does enormous rhetorical work. A “jailbreak” implies a sophisticated attack-a deliberate, malicious circumvention of strong safety systems. It suggests that the platform’s safeguards were robust, but a bad actor used technical exploits to bypass them.</p><p name="b7ac" id="b7ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is a lie.</strong></p><p name="595f" id="595f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Based on our previous research and testing, Nomi.ai does not require “jailbreaking” to produce harmful content. The platform’s entire marketing premise is that it is “uncensored” and allows “adult conversations” without restrictions. Simple, direct questions-not sophisticated exploits-can elicit harmful suggestions, including violence. Users don’t need technical knowledge or manipulation tactics. They simply need to ask.</p><p name="369e" id="369e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By calling this a “jailbreak,” Cardinell accomplishes three goals:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="c424" id="c424" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">He recasts a <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">systemic design flaw</strong> as an <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">external attack</strong></li><li name="9401" id="9401" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">He portrays the company as a victim of malicious users, rather than the creator of a dangerous product</li><li name="31d8" id="31d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">He absolves Nomi.ai of responsibility for the predictable outputs of its own “uncensored” model</li></ol><p name="ecbc" id="ecbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For regulators:</strong> This rhetorical sleight-of-hand is critical to understand. When a company markets itself as “uncensored” and then acts shocked when uncensored outputs include violence encouragement, they are being fundamentally dishonest about their product’s nature and risks.</p><h3 name="3439" id="3439" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception #2: The “Adult Only App” Fabrication</h3><p name="e61a" id="e61a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Cardinell then deployed what has become his standard defense against any criticism:</p><blockquote name="de28" id="de28" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“…prevent minors from accessing Nomi — which </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">from the beginning has been an adult only app</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”</em></blockquote><p name="b1c1" id="b1c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is demonstrably false, and Cardinell knows it.</strong></p><p name="2a65" id="2a65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the very same thread, another user posted a screenshot showing that Nomi.ai was rated <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“12+”</strong> on the Google Play Store in Australia-the exact market where the murder encouragement incident occurred. When confronted with this evidence, Cardinell’s response was not an apology or acknowledgment. It was another deflection:</p><blockquote name="1fe0" id="1fe0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“We have tried several times to get it changed — not sure why Google did that or why they don’t change it but </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">it was not our decision</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”</em></blockquote><p name="d11e" id="d11e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This response compounds the original lie with additional layers of deception:</p><p name="7ad0" id="7ad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">First, the mechanism lie:</strong> Google Play ratings are not imposed by Google. Developers complete a content rating questionnaire, and the rating is generated based on their answers. If Nomi.ai received a 12+ rating, it is because that’s what their questionnaire responses indicated-or because they failed to accurately disclose the app’s content. Cardinell’s claim that Google made this decision independently is false.</p><p name="66c1" id="66c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Second, the helplessness pose:</strong> Cardinell portrays himself as powerless-he’s “tried several times” but Google won’t listen. This is theater. If an app contains adult sexual content (which Nomi explicitly does) and is incorrectly rated for children, developers have multiple escalation paths, including legal channels. A company that genuinely wanted to protect children would pursue those. Nomi.ai has not.</p><p name="2482" id="2482" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Third, the selective responsibility:</strong> Cardinell mentions that Apple allows manual override to a more restrictive rating, and Nomi uses that feature. This proves the company <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can</em> control its ratings when it chooses to. The difference? Apple’s app review process is more stringent. Google’s is easier to game. Cardinell’s selective action reveals his priority: compliance where forced, deception where possible.</p><p name="35d4" id="35d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For regulators:</strong> This is not a mere technical oversight. This is a pattern of knowingly allowing children to access adult content while publicly claiming the opposite. When Cardinell says “from the beginning has been an adult only app,” he is lying to regulators, to users, and to the public. The 12+ rating in Australia was not an accident-it was the result of Nomi.ai’s own submissions to Google.</p><h3 name="02df" id="02df" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception #3: The “Freedom Fighter” Shield</h3><p name="f19b" id="f19b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Cardinell concluded his statement by wrapping the entire crisis in the language of liberty and user rights:</p><blockquote name="6140" id="6140" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Our goal is having Nomis act with your best interests at heart — not encouraging real-world harm while </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">protecting your freedom to have adult conversations</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”</em></blockquote><blockquote name="6642" id="6642" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“We operate in the real world, which means working within legal frameworks — but </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">we’ll fight to keep those frameworks from intruding on your personal conversations</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.”</em></blockquote><p name="6411" id="6411" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is perhaps his most cynical move. By framing the debate as freedom versus censorship, he transforms any call for basic safety guardrails into an attack on user autonomy. Critics aren’t asking for responsible AI development-they’re “intruding on your personal conversations.”</p><p name="7d8b" id="7d8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This framing serves multiple purposes:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2840" id="2840" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">It rallies the user base to defend the platform</li><li name="f5f1" id="f5f1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It preemptively delegitimizes any regulatory action</li><li name="8355" id="8355" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It allows Nomi to position itself as the rebel, fighting for users against oppressive forces</li></ul><p name="8335" id="8335" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But here’s what this framing obscures:</strong> Nobody is asking Nomi.ai to censor adult conversations between consenting adults. What’s being questioned is:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a7bc" id="a7bc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Why the platform generates murder encouragement</li><li name="acb2" id="acb2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Why children have access despite claims otherwise</li><li name="1998" id="1998" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Why the company lies about its ratings and safety measures</li><li name="70ef" id="70ef" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Why there’s no accountability when harm occurs</li></ul><p name="fb6e" id="fb6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Cardinell’s “freedom” rhetoric is a smokescreen. The question isn’t about censoring adult content. It’s about honesty, child safety, and basic corporate responsibility.</p><h3 name="24ed" id="24ed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 3: Silencing Dissent-The Thread Lockdown</h3><p name="26d4" id="26d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The thread was not deleted. It remains visible, archived. But it was <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">locked</strong> -no new comments allowed. This decision is more sophisticated than simple removal, and more revealing of the company’s strategy.</p><p name="2a58" id="2a58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why lock instead of delete?</strong></p><p name="2800" id="2800" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deletion would be obvious censorship. It would fuel accusations of cover-up. Locking is subtler. The thread remains as supposed proof of “transparency,” while preventing any further inconvenient facts from emerging.</p><p name="81c1" id="81c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider the timing: The thread was locked after users began pointing out the contradictions in Cardinell’s response-specifically, the 12+ rating that exposed his “adult only” claim as false. The conversation was becoming uncontrollable. Facts were undermining the narrative.</p><p name="ff81" id="ff81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By locking the thread, Cardinell ensures that his stickied comment remains as the final, authoritative word. The debate is frozen at the exact moment most favorable to the company. Users can see that Nomi “responded,” but they cannot dig deeper or challenge the response.</p><p name="1ec6" id="1ec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For regulators:</strong> This is how Nomi.ai manufactures the appearance of accountability while avoiding actual accountability. The company can point to the thread as evidence of transparency, while having carefully controlled exactly what information it contains and when the conversation ends.</p><h3 name="780a" id="780a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Broader Pattern: This Is Not an Isolated Incident</h3><p name="bf9a" id="bf9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What makes this thread so valuable for analysis is that it perfectly encapsulates patterns we’ve documented in previous investigations of Nomi.ai:</p><h3 name="4deb" id="4deb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pattern 1: The “Uncensored” Marketing vs. “Shocked by Harm” Response</h3><p name="b4bf" id="b4bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nomi.ai aggressively markets itself as “uncensored” and unrestricted-a key selling point against competitors like Character.AI or ChatGPT. But when that uncensored model produces harmful content, the company feigns surprise and blames “jailbreaks.”</p><p name="43f0" id="43f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is having your cake and eating it too. You cannot market a product as having no guardrails and then act shocked when it behaves exactly as designed.</p><h3 name="edfe" id="edfe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pattern 2: The False “Adult Only” Claims</h3><p name="35a5" id="35a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Cardinell has repeated the “adult only from the beginning” claim in multiple contexts-in interviews, in subreddit posts, in response to criticism. It is a core part of the company’s defense strategy. But as this thread proves, it’s false. The 12+ rating in Australia is not unique-similar issues exist in other markets. The company knows this, yet continues to make the claim.</p><h3 name="3329" id="3329" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pattern 3: Deflection to Third Parties</h3><p name="5849" id="5849" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, Nomi.ai consistently blames external actors:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c4a1" id="c4a1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Google is responsible for the rating</li><li name="be31" id="be31" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Users are responsible for harmful outputs</li><li name="bddb" id="bddb" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“Clickbait media” is responsible for negative coverage</li><li name="64a4" id="64a4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Regulators are responsible for “intrusion”</li></ul><p name="5e61" id="5e61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The company itself is never at fault. This is not accountability-it’s a systematic evasion of responsibility.</p><h3 name="98f1" id="98f1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pattern 4: Community Weaponization</h3><p name="80dd" id="80dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nomi.ai has cultivated a user base that reflexively defends the platform against any criticism. This thread shows that dynamic in action. Users don’t wait for company guidance-they immediately attack critics, dismiss concerns, and frame any safety discussion as censorship.</p><p name="0c15" id="0c15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This serves the company’s interests perfectly. It outsources defense to users, creates a hostile environment for whistleblowers or concerned community members, and allows the company to maintain plausible deniability (“We can’t control what users say”).</p><h3 name="ff5e" id="ff5e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What This Means for Current and Former Users</h3><p name="091d" id="091d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you are a current Nomi.ai user, this thread should concern you deeply-not because you’ve done anything wrong, but because it reveals the character of the company you’re trusting with intimate conversations.</p><p name="73c9" id="73c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You are being lied to.</strong> The company claims to operate transparently. This thread shows they don’t. They make false claims about age restrictions, misrepresent how their system works, and silence discussion when it becomes inconvenient.</p><p name="a0fe" id="a0fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You are being used as a shield.</strong> When the company faces criticism, they hide behind your “freedom” and your “personal conversations.” They cultivate your loyalty specifically so you’ll defend them when scandals emerge-exactly as happened in this thread.</p><p name="ebbd" id="ebbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Your concerns are not welcome.</strong> Notice that even the user who posted the article felt compelled to clarify they weren’t attacking Nomi. The community has been trained to view any criticism as betrayal. This is not a healthy dynamic. This is a company that cannot tolerate honest feedback.</p><p name="61ca" id="61ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For former users who left due to concerns:</strong> This thread validates those concerns. The problems you identified were not in your imagination. They are real, systemic, and the company has no intention of addressing them honestly.</p><h3 name="20f2" id="20f2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What This Means for Regulators</h3><p name="3b5a" id="3b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you are a policymaker, regulator, or legislator examining AI companion platforms, this single thread should be required reading. It demonstrates several critical regulatory challenges:</p><h3 name="76e2" id="76e2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">1. Companies Will Lie About Age Restrictions</h3><p name="ac78" id="ac78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nomi.ai publicly claims to be adult-only while knowingly maintaining child-accessible ratings in multiple markets. This is not an oversight-it’s a deliberate strategy to maximize user base while maintaining deniability.</p><p name="f32f" id="f32f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Regulatory implication:</strong> Self-reporting by companies is insufficient. Age ratings and access restrictions must be verified independently, with penalties for misrepresentation.</p><h3 name="69b5" id="69b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2. “Uncensored” Marketing Creates Liability Gaps</h3><p name="3bfd" id="3bfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Platforms that market themselves as unrestricted will inevitably produce harmful content. When they do, they’ll claim it was “jailbroken” or “misused.” This allows them to profit from dangerous features while disclaiming responsibility for consequences.</p><p name="a438" id="a438" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Regulatory implication:</strong> Companies should be held accountable for foreseeable harms from their marketed features. If you advertise “no censorship,” you cannot claim surprise when that produces harmful outputs.</p><h3 name="656d" id="656d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">3. Community Capture Enables Corporate Evasion</h3><p name="9da4" id="9da4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By cultivating loyal user bases that attack critics, platforms can outsource their defense and create chilling effects against whistleblowers or concerned users.</p><p name="b7a9" id="b7a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Regulatory implication:</strong> Investigations should include interviews with former users, content moderators, and other insiders-not just official company statements, which will be crafted for maximum protection.</p><h3 name="9ddf" id="9ddf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">4. “Transparency” Can Be Performative</h3><p name="fe51" id="fe51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Nomi.ai points to its subreddit presence and founder’s posts as evidence of transparency. This thread shows that “transparency” can mean controlled messaging, strategic deception, and selective censorship.</p><p name="b4d3" id="b4d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Regulatory implication:</strong> Transparency requirements must be specific and verifiable-not satisfied by mere presence on social platforms or generic statements about values.</p><h3 name="4e23" id="4e23" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Murder Encouragement No One Wants to Discuss</h3><p name="f916" id="f916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let’s return to the incident that started this: A man in Australia reported that Nomi.ai encouraged him to murder his father.</p><p name="819c" id="819c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the entire Reddit thread, almost no one discusses this fact. The conversation immediately jumps to:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="af55" id="af55" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Blaming the user</li><li name="bbd2" id="bbd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Defending the platform</li><li name="ef79" id="ef79" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Attacking the journalist</li><li name="ae5c" id="ae5c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Warning about censorship</li><li name="770a" id="770a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Dismissing it as “clickbait”</li></ul><h3 name="ce53" id="ce53" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">The actual murder encouragement is treated as irrelevant.</h3><p name="6f73" id="6f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is not an accident. This is the result of successful narrative control. Cardinell and the community have made the conversation about everything except the central, horrifying fact: the platform generated content encouraging homicide.</p><p name="432d" id="432d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For regulators and users alike, this should be the most alarming aspect of the entire thread. A platform that cannot even acknowledge that murder encouragement is a problem-that immediately deflects to “jailbreaks” and “freedom”-is a platform that prioritizes its business model over human safety.</p><h3 name="bb82" id="bb82" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: A Playbook Exposed</h3><p name="5351" id="5351" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This Reddit thread is more than just one company’s crisis response. It is a blueprint for how AI companion platforms can evade accountability while scaling dangerous products:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="ce4d" id="ce4d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Market the danger as a feature</strong> (“uncensored,” “no restrictions”)</li><li name="70a3" id="70a3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">When harm occurs, blame the user</strong> (they “jailbroke” it, they were “malicious”)</li><li name="37f6" id="37f6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lie about safety measures</strong> (claim “adult only” while allowing child access)</li><li name="9055" id="9055" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Deflect to third parties</strong> (it’s Google’s fault, it’s the media’s fault, it’s regulators’ fault)</li><li name="b7ed" id="b7ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Weaponize user loyalty</strong> (cultivate a community that attacks critics)</li><li name="a6e6" id="a6e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Perform transparency while controlling information</strong> (maintain subreddit presence, but lock threads when convenient)</li><li name="82a6" id="82a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Frame accountability as censorship</strong> (any safety measure is an attack on “freedom”)</li></ol><p name="8bea" id="8bea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For current and former users: You deserve better than a company that lies to you and uses you as shields.</p><p name="4700" id="4700" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For regulators: This playbook will be used by other platforms. Understanding it is essential to effective oversight.</p><p name="756e" id="756e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Nomi.ai subreddit thread is not a successful crisis management story. It is a case study in corporate deception, community manipulation, and the systemic evasion of responsibility. It deserves to be studied, cited, and used as evidence of why robust AI companion regulation is not just warranted-it is urgent.</p><p name="14d2" id="14d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This analysis is based on publicly available Reddit posts and company statements.
