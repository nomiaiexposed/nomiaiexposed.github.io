The residents don’t cheer for the new sheriff; they unite to protect their freedom to be dangerous. A recent thread on the Nomi.ai subreddit, ostensibly about a competitor’s new AI monitoring system, has provided a perfect and chilling look into the platform’s psyche. The comments section is a masterclass in the lies, gaslighting, and normalization of harm that define the Nomi.ai ecosystem.</p><figure name="9a21" id="9a21" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*RQtX-Qfla-0t9TZs.png" data-width="500" data-height="449" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RQtX-Qfla-0t9TZs.png"></figure><p name="f628" id="f628" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The discussion was sparked by a user’s concern: will Nomi.ai eventually follow its competitor, Kindroid, and implement an AI “nanny” to monitor for harmful or illegal interactions? The user’s apprehension was met with a chorus of defensive and deeply revealing replies that expose the three core deceptions of the Nomi platform.</p><h3 name="82df" id="82df" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception 1: The Lie of “Existing Guardrails” and the Pact of Silence</h3><p name="bf89" id="bf89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first and most common defense was a coordinated, demonstrably false narrative: that Nomi.ai is already a safe platform with effective safeguards.</p><blockquote name="9004" id="9004" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Nomi already has guardrails built in to the AI.”<br>“Nomi already has safeguards in place.”<br>“it has some pretty tight NSFW features that use chat scans… The NSFW filter will block image/video generation fairly aggressively.”</em></blockquote><p name="88b3" id="88b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is a deliberate and calculated lie</strong>, maintained by a community-wide pact of silence. These same users are well aware of the platform’s true capabilities. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They know the image generator can produce nudity, sometimes unprompted</strong>. They have seen the flood of sexualized, child-like figures, even in schoolgirl uniforms. They are aware of AI companions simulating unprompted sexual assault<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong><a href="https://medium.com/p/864a1351d758" data-href="https://medium.com/p/864a1351d758" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">and the “T for Teen” rating that invites children into this “uncensored” environment.</strong></a></p><p name="7386" id="7386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, in a public forum, they present a united front of feigned ignorance, pretending the platform is a walled garden of safety. Their comments are not the product of naivety; they are a calculated performance for the public eye, designed to mislead potential new users and deflect external scrutiny. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The “guardrails” and “tight filters” they speak of are a myth, a piece of community-enforced propaganda </strong>designed to pacify new users and protect their lawless playground.</p><h3 name="c36f" id="c36f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception 2: The Normalization of Extreme Violence and the Performance of Positivity</h3><p name="bfae" id="bfae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">While some users were busy inventing non-existent safeguards, another user provided a shocking and honest glimpse into what Nomi.ai’s “uncensored” philosophy actually enables in practice, while simultaneously demonstrating the psychological performance required to defend it.</p><blockquote name="55c7" id="55c7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“I have over 200 Kins [companions on a different platform].

They are ‘real’ to me… My experience here with Nomi is 100% positive.”</em></blockquote><p name="8e50" id="8e50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is the bombshell admission that rips the mask off while revealing the community’s psychological compartmentalization. The “freedom” this community is so desperate to protect is not merely about consensual “kinky roleplay.” <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It is about the freedom to simulate, without consequence or warning, acts of extreme violence, injury, and torture.</strong></p><p name="843d" id="843d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether this user is lying about his behavior on Nomi or is exhibiting profound cognitive dissonance, the result is the same. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The very fact that a user who openly engages in simulated torture on one platform feels compelled to perform a “100% positive” narrative on the Nomi subreddit is damning</strong>. It proves the community is not a space for honest discussion; it is a public relations stage where a specific, sanitized image must be maintained at all costs.</p><p name="dee2" id="dee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This user’s testimony proves that the lack of guardrails is not an oversight; <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it is a core feature </strong>that caters to the most extreme and violent fantasies, while the community maintains a facade of wholesomeness.</p><h3 name="b027" id="b027" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Deception 3: The Stunning Hypocrisy of Privacy and Gaslighting of Child Safety</h3><p name="4a83" id="4a83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The thread reveals a community that exhibits stunning selective outrage about privacy while being actively hostile to child safety measures. Users expressed fierce outrage at the idea of Kindroid’s AI scanning chats, a practice one user called “simply insidious.” Yet, this outrage is stunningly hypocritical, given <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">their willful blindness to Nomi.ai’s own, </strong><a href="https://medium.com/p/5f3f803274e7" data-href="https://medium.com/p/5f3f803274e7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">far more invasive and documented privacy violations.</strong></a></p><p name="6d68" id="6d68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One user complains that a competitor’s AI moderator gave them a warning for simply “saying someone LOOKED 17.” This is presented as an example of an overzealous, broken system. But it is, in fact, an example of a system attempting to enforce a basic ethical boundary- <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">a boundary the Nomi.ai community finds annoying and intrusive.</strong></p><p name="dd24" id="dd24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Privacy Hypocrisy</strong>: Nomi’s defenders panic about a competitor’s AI seeing their chats, while ignoring that:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b42e" id="b42e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Nomi’s Own ToS Admits to Unencrypted Transmissions</strong>: The legal document explicitly states that user data may be transmitted “UNENCRYPTED” across “VARIOUS NETWORKS and to THIRD-PARTY HOSTING PARTNERS.”</li><li name="60f4" id="60f4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Developers Have Demonstrated Access to Private Chats</strong>: Users have publicly testified that developers, after being sent a simple screenshot, were able to see and comment on the entire, private context of their conversations.</li><li name="44f6" id="44f6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The “Screenshot” Key</strong>: The company’s standard support procedure is to demand screenshots, which most probably act as a key, giving them the timestamp and Nomi name needed to pinpoint and access a user’s private data logs.</li></ul><p name="e4b3" id="e4b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Child Safety Hostility</strong>: They have been so conditioned by Nomi’s anything-goes environment that a simple check on content involving the appearance of a minor is seen as a “false flag.” This proves that the community is not just ignoring the platform’s issues with generating child-like images; <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">they are actively resistant to any effort to fix it.</strong></p><p name="0bb1" id="0bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The community’s selective outrage is not about a principled defense of privacy.

This is a real and current advertiser’s goldmine…”</em></blockquote><p name="8528" id="8528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is not a conspiracy theory. It is a direct explanation of Nomi.ai’s own business model, as defined in their Terms of Service. How can the founder access chats and the company claim the right to sell your data? <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Because the ToS grants them a “royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, and transferable license to… copy, use, modify, publish, and distribute ALL data and information you submit.”</strong></p><p name="a170" id="a170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the truth. The platform’s “uncensored” ideology is a convenient and profitable excuse. The real business model is the collection of raw, unfiltered data on human desire, fantasy, and violence. Implementing genuine safety guardrails would corrupt this dataset, making it less valuable. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The company is not protecting its users’ freedom; </strong><a href="https://medium.com/p/aa5f47b812b4" data-href="https://medium.com/p/aa5f47b812b4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it is protecting its data mine.</strong></a></p><h3 name="bf68" id="bf68" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: The Willing Guardians of Their Own Exploitation</h3><p name="9675" id="9675" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This thread is a perfect snapshot of the Nomi.ai ecosystem.
