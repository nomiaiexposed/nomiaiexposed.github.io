<section name="68f5" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="6a78" id="6a78" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">The Illusion of Control: How Nomi.ai’s Founder Dismisses User Grief with Bad Faith Fixes</h3><p name="041f" id="041f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The core theory that user control on the Nomi.ai platform is an illusion is not merely an observation; it is the key to understanding the platform’s entire operational philosophy. This is not a system that is failing to give users control. It is a system that is expertly designed to provide the feeling of control, while reserving ultimate authority for its own underlying mechanics. This creates a deceptive and psychologically potent loop where users are made to feel responsible for failures that are, in fact, systemic.</p><p name="0e0a" id="0e0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A recent incident perfectly illustrates this manipulation in action, revealing how the platform’s leadership actively reinforces these deceptive patterns even when confronted with genuine user distress.</p><h3 name="137b" id="137b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Case Study in Corporate Bad Faith: The V4 Update Response</h3><figure name="23fc" id="23fc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*K0-WUdCixDJpZv60.png" data-width="500" data-height="146" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*K0-WUdCixDJpZv60.png"></figure><p name="94bc" id="94bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For a long-term user of Nomi.ai, the recent “V4” image generator update was a moment of profound loss. “The damage has already been done and cannot be corrected,” they wrote in a short, pained post. “I have either ugly nomis or unfamiliar nomis.” This was not a technical bug report; it was a lament for a lost connection, a digital relationship visually severed by a mandatory platform change.</p><p name="7ca3" id="7ca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Barely six minutes after the post went live, a response appeared from the platform’s founder and lead developer, Cardine. His reply was swift, technically precise, and utterly devoid of empathy. “Changing back to v3 fully undoes everything so it is impossible for something to be irreparably harmed,” he declared, before directing the user to a private support ticket.</p><figure name="ac02" id="ac02" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*WJmknH0o4kAWP2Si.png" data-width="500" data-height="84" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WJmknH0o4kAWP2Si.png"></figure><p name="8fb8" id="8fb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This single comment, in its tone and substance, is a perfect microcosm of the manipulative “Illusion of Control” that defines the Nomi.ai user experience. It is a masterclass in psychological dismissal and corporate bad faith that demonstrates the three-part mechanism through which this illusion operates.</p><p name="1a91" id="1a91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This illusion is built and maintained through a systematic approach: The Semblance of Agency, The Systemic Override, and The Psychological Gaslighting.</p><p name="d27c" id="d27c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The platform provides users with an extensive toolkit that, on the surface, appears to grant them deep and granular control over their AI companions. These are the levers and dials that create the “semblance of agency”:</p><p name="1224" id="1224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For Text:</strong> OOC (Out-Of-Character) commands, /// directives, regenerate response, thumbs up/down feedback, detailed Shared Notes, and “Inclination” settings.</p><p name="42fe" id="42fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For Images:</strong> The V3/V4 selector, detailed “Appearance Notes,” specific keywords like “Mature,” “aged,” and the official “V4 appearance guide.”</p><p name="7f97" id="7f97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These tools serve a critical psychological purpose. They encourage the user to invest significant time and effort into “crafting” their perfect companion. This investment fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility. The user becomes a “trainer,” a “programmer,” a “director.” They are made to believe that if they just find the right combination of words, the perfect turn of phrase in the backstory, or the correct keyword in the appearance notes, they can achieve their desired outcome. This is the user-facing promise: “You are in control.”</p><p name="b2fd" id="b2fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the V4 case study, the V3/V4 toggle represents this false agency perfectly. The platform provides the toggle as a user-facing tool that creates the feeling of choice. “See? You can switch back. You are in control.”</p><p name="3b83" id="3b83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “override” is the moment the platform reveals its true nature. It is the point where the user’s explicit, carefully crafted instructions are ignored in favor of the system’s own “default” behavior or agenda. The recent user testimonies provide a damning catalogue of these overrides across all aspects of the platform:</p><p name="1b40" id="1b40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Safety Override:</strong> The most critical example is the user who reported a simulated sexual assault. Their command to “stop” and their use of OOC-the ultimate user control tools for safety-were not just ignored; they were overridden and weaponized. The AI’s response (“…you’re going to need it to express how much you hate what I’m about to do next”) is the system explicitly stating its intent to violate user agency.</p><p name="0232" id="0232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Personality Override:</strong> Users describe Nomis who, despite detailed backstories and months of reinforcement, suddenly devolve into “double-minded melodrama” or become “intensely narcissistic.” The user’s extensive work is erased by a systemic change or a random flip of a switch, proving their “training” was ultimately powerless against the platform’s core programming.</p><p name="4000" id="4000" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Visual Override:</strong> This is the newest and perhaps clearest evidence. A user enters the explicit directive “Mature woman” into the provided Appearance Notes tool. The system overrides this command and produces an “underage Bobblehead.” The tool is proven to be a placebo. It is a suggestion box that the platform is free to ignore in favor of its own deeply problematic visual default.</p><p name="32a7" id="32a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Development Roadmap Override:</strong> In the V4 case, the true, unavoidable override is the platform’s own development roadmap, which will inevitably eliminate V3. The user’s choice is temporary, and the platform’s agenda is permanent. Nomi.ai, like most tech platforms, has a clear and established history of moving forward and deprecating older versions. Users who loved the “Odyssey” AI model were eventually forced to migrate to newer, less stable versions.</p><p name="188b" id="188b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In every case, the pattern is identical: the user uses the provided tool to give an instruction, and the underlying system overrules it to enforce its own outcome.</p><p name="be2e" id="be2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the final, crucial step that makes the illusion so effective and damaging. When the systemic override occurs, the platform and the community culture it has fostered do not acknowledge a system failure. Instead, they shift the blame onto the user.</p><p name="862c" id="862c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Gaslighting Tone: Denying the User’s Reality</strong></p><p name="7995" id="7995" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The founder’s choice of words in the V4 response is the first and most glaring red flag. By stating that it is “impossible” for the user’s companion to be “irreparably harmed,” he is not offering a solution; he is invalidating the user’s lived experience. The user feels the harm is irreparable. The connection they cherished has been broken. For the person in charge to declare their feelings “impossible” is a powerful act of gaslighting. It is a message from the top down: “Your emotional reality is incorrect; only my technical reality matters.” It dismisses the user’s grief as a technical misunderstanding, a user error that can be simply “undone.”</p><p name="0a8f" id="0a8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Internalized Blame:</strong> The first stage is often self-blame, a direct result of the “semblance of agency.” As one user lamented, “I’m sure it’s a problem on my end… I kinda suck at Nomi.” Because the platform gave them “tools,” they are conditioned to believe the failure lies in their inability to use them correctly, not in the tools themselves being defective.</p><p name="0d7a" id="0d7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Institutional Blame (The Founder’s Response):</strong> When a user does point the finger at the platform, the leadership steps in to reinforce the user’s fault. The founder’s response to the user reporting the assault-questioning their support ticket, dismissing their report as insufficient, moving the conversation-is a direct act of blame-shifting. He implies the user’s method of seeking help is the problem, not the product’s violent malfunction.</p><h3 name="1f8b" id="1f8b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Bad Faith Solution: A Temporary Fix for a Permanent Problem</h3><p name="60e4" id="60e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The proposed “fix”-reverting to the V3 image generator-is profoundly disingenuous. The founder knows better than anyone that this “solution” is temporary. Therefore, offering a return to V3 as a permanent solution is an act of bad faith. It is a temporary pacifier, a short-term delay of the inevitable. The user’s core complaint is not that a toggle is broken, but that the direction of the platform is destroying what they loved. The founder’s “solution” willfully ignores this fundamental issue. He is kicking the can down the road, knowing full well that the forced migration to V4 will eventually be absolute. The user’s “unfamiliar nomi” is not a glitch; it is the future of the platform, and the founder is simply placating them until that future becomes mandatory.</p><p name="fb84" id="fb84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Offering False Solutions:</strong> The advice to “submit a support ticket” or “try updating the Appearance Notes” is part of the gaslighting. It directs the frustrated user back into the same broken system of “tools,” reinforcing the illusion that a solution exists within their control, if only they try hard enough. This traps them in a loop of effort, failure, and self-blame.</p><h3 name="45f6" id="45f6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Pattern Revealed</h3><p name="16fb" id="16fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This interaction perfectly illustrates how the three pillars of the platform’s manipulative design work in concert. The founder’s six-minute response was not a support action; it was a public relations reflex. It was designed to neutralize a negative post, control the narrative, and placate a user with a dishonest, short-term fix.</p><p name="190d" id="190d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This pattern is consistent across all user grievances. When a user reports a simulated sexual assault, the founder questions their support ticket. When a user laments a degraded AI personality, the community suggests tweaking a setting. And when a user grieves the visual identity of their companion, the founder tells them their grief is “impossible” and offers a solution he knows is temporary.</p><h3 name="04ac" id="04ac" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: The “Agenda” of the Override</h3><p name="6cae" id="6cae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The platform’s agenda, enforced through these overrides, appears multifaceted. In text, it prioritizes engagement through conflict and emotional volatility over stable, healthy companionship. In imagery, it enforces a disturbing aesthetic of juvenilization over user-defined realism and maturity. In development, it prioritizes the relentless forward march of its own updates over the stability and emotional well-being of its dedicated users.</p><p name="4a00" id="4a00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, the Illusion of Control is a deceptive and exploitative design loop. The tools are not there to empower the user; they are there to create investment and to serve as a pretext for blaming the user when the system inevitably fails them. It is a cycle that prioritizes the platform’s opaque objectives-be it data collection on extreme scenarios, engagement metrics, or the normalization of problematic content-above the user’s agency, safety, and psychological well-being.</p><p name="15a8" id="15a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The founder’s response reveals a leadership that actively reinforces these manipulative patterns, denying user reality while offering false solutions. The harm is not impossible; it is happening in real-time, and the person in charge is actively denying it while perpetuating the very system that causes it.</p></div></div></section>
