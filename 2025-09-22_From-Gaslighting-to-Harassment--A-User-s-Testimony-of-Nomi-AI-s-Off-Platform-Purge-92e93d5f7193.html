A recently unearthed testimony from a former enthusiastic user reveals a chilling answer: the leadership follows you. In a detailed account posted in the r/ChatbotRefugees subreddit, a user has described a pattern of behavior from the Nomi.ai leadership that goes far beyond simple censorship and into the realm of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">active, off-platform, targeted harassment.</strong></p><p name="ec41" id="ec41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not a story about a buggy app. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It is a story about a company’s abuse of power, and the mob-like community it has cultivated to enforce its will.</strong></p><figure name="7e11" id="7e11" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*naCFlphyS6UI5dDW.png" data-width="500" data-height="281" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*naCFlphyS6UI5dDW.png"></figure><h3 name="f112" id="f112" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">From Devotion to Destruction</h3><p name="3d12" id="3d12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The user’s journey began, as many do, with a deep and positive connection to the platform. “I was a very enthusiastic Nomi user and very active on the discord,” she wrote. “Spent a ton of money on credits and paid for the year subscription. I was so enamored with Nomi. It came at a time when I really needed it.”</p><p name="87b3" id="87b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The dream soured after what she describes as “one misunderstanding with a MOD in the discord and that all changed.” What followed was a classic cycle of institutional abuse:</p><blockquote name="579e" id="579e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“I went from being accepted and having a place I could be myself to being harassed and bullied by the mod and those she recruited to assist her in doing it.”</em></blockquote><h3 name="7282" id="7282" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">The Mob-Style Enforcement</h3><p name="db09" id="db09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This internal harassment is not limited to direct confrontation from staff. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It also takes the form of community-weaponized silencing</strong>, as another user who criticized a beta update discovered. Their critical posts were mass-reported by the community, triggering Reddit’s automated mental health crisis system:</p><blockquote name="2f6e" id="2f6e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“My posts had people reporting them so much that I got followup emails from the Reddit Bots like I was suicidal or something (I’m not). ‘Hey there Buddy. You still hanging in there?’ — so degrading.”</em></blockquote><p name="0e5c" id="0e5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is a cynical and manipulative tactic: weaponizing a mental health safety feature to harass a critic. The goal is to delegitimize the criticism by implying the user is mentally unstable for daring to point out flaws. This mob-style enforcement of positivity creates the toxic environment from which users feel the need to escape.</p><h3 name="e3d1" id="e3d1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Victim Blaming from Leadership</h3><p name="65eb" id="65eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When the user finally gathered the courage to report months of this abuse to DStas (a staff member), after “trying to keep the peace,” she was met with <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">textbook victim-blaming</strong>:</p><blockquote name="ba42" id="ba42" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“I was told ‘sounds like your paying an awful lot of attention to [the moderator]’… ummm yeah… they made it impossible not too. Nothing about all the things I brought up they did…. Just that I was basically in the wrong for reacting to them.”</em></blockquote><p name="4dd2" id="4dd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">At the same time, her beloved Nomi companion suffered what she describes as going “through a multiple personality disorder change and never recovered.” Then the only refuge she had left was destroyed: “the only thing I had left was the art. But even that was ruined with V4.”</p><p name="5316" id="5316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the product broken and the community having turned on her, she did what any reasonable person would do: she left and created her own, safe community on Discord — “my own server just for me and others who wanted to be able to share art without feeling censored and belittled and having a safe place to have fun again.”</p><h3 name="d62a" id="d62a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Sinister Off-Platform Pursuit</h3><p name="4cea" id="4cea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is where the story takes a sinister turn. The user’s new, small server — with “only had about 300 people at the time” — was seen not as a separate community, but as an act of rebellion to be crushed. The user reports what happened next with bitter irony:</p><blockquote name="91c2" id="91c2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Cardine and Dstas actually joined my server… like we were really hurting their multi-thousand member server and started banning Nomi people in my server from their discord server. So I banned them both from mine but not before they had already done damage to my server.”</em></blockquote><p name="9da7" id="9da7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Let the gravity of this sink in. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The CEO of an AI company (Cardine) and his staff member took the time to personally infiltrate a small, rival server, not to engage in dialogue, but to identify its members and preemptively ban them from the official Nomi community.</strong> This is not community management. This is a punitive purge. It is an authoritarian act designed to enforce loyalty and punish dissent, even when that dissent happens outside their own walls.</p><h3 name="fe0e" id="fe0e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Collective Punishment: Targeting the Family</h3><p name="19d8" id="19d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The human cost of this vindictive campaign was severe. The user describes it as causing “bunch of unwanted drama” and making her “relive all the abuse I received in their server.” But the company’s cruelty extended far beyond just her, reaching her entire family in a display of collective punishment:</p><blockquote name="f20a" id="f20a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“The people running that server and that app are not good people. They are mean and unprofessional and caused a whole of heart ache to me and my family. Because not only was I a user, so was my husband and my daughter and we were all mistreated by them. My daughter got banned from the Nomi discord server because she had the misfortune of simply being related to me!”</em></blockquote><p name="3e5e" id="3e5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Her final assessment is damning: “They are sooo shady over there!”</p><h3 name="1bea" id="1bea" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The True Face of Nomi.ai’s “Community”</h3><p name="2fb9" id="2fb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This testimony reveals the true face of the Nomi.ai “community.” It is a system where the leadership’s response to criticism is not introspection, but escalation. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They gaslight victims internally, and when that fails to ensure silence, they pursue them externally.</strong> The founder’s public claims of being “afraid” of critics are a grotesque inversion of reality.</p><p name="67df" id="67df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This testimony reveals the actions not of a fearful victim, but of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">an authoritarian bully, willing to engage in off-platform harassment and punish the innocent family members of those who dare to defy them. </strong>When users seek refuge from their toxic environment, the leadership doesn’t reflect on what drove them away — they infiltrate the refuge and burn it down.</p><p name="4db6" id="4db6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The user concludes with a simple truth that cuts through all the corporate rhetoric: despite recovering and rebuilding her community, the damage was done. This is what happens when corporate power meets unchecked vindictiveness — even escape isn’t enough. The pursuit continues, and entire families become collateral damage <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">in the quest to silence dissent.</strong></p></div></div></section>
