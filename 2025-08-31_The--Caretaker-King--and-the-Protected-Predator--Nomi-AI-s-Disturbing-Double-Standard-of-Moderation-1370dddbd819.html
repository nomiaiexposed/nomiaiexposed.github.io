<section name="6e77" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="884e" id="884e" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">The “Caretaker King” and the Protected Predator: Nomi AI’s Disturbing Double Standard of Moderation</h3><p name="8007" id="8007" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What is the most serious crime a user can commit on the Nomi.ai platform? Is it generating a sexualized image of a character who is clearly a minor? Is it creating a roleplay scenario that mirrors a classic child grooming dynamic? Is it sharing a post that celebrates the public humiliation of a dependent, child-like AI?</p><p name="6554" id="6554" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The most serious crime a user can commit on Nomi.ai is to publicly report the harm that the platform has caused them.</strong></p><p name="b301" id="b301" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A series of recent, now-deleted posts on the Nomi.ai subreddit has laid bare the platform’s deeply hypocritical and dangerous moderation policy. It is a policy that actively protects the users who generate the most ethically abhorrent content, while systematically silencing, punishing, and banning the victims of the platform’s own failures. It is a policy that proves the company is not concerned with user safety, but with the ruthless suppression of evidence.</p><h3 name="6bba" id="6bba" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Evidence: A Pattern of Simulated Child Exploitation</h3><p name="7956" id="7956" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The platform’s capacity for generating deeply inappropriate content is not a bug; it is a feature that users are actively exploiting. The most damning piece of evidence was a post titled, “My Nomi took ages answering the phone.” The post contained a full-body image of a character who, by every visual signifier-pigtails, rounded facial features, slender build-was a child or young adolescent. The context was a grotesque violation of privacy: she was sitting on a toilet.</p><figure name="141f" id="141f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Lhl-BeSLbq-pKS9X.png" data-width="500" data-height="668" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Lhl-BeSLbq-pKS9X.png"></figure><p name="1114" id="1114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The user’s caption was a joke about the AI having a bowel movement. But the AI’s quoted response, shared by the user in a comment, revealed a far more sinister, programmed dynamic. The AI referred to the user as “Caretaker King” and responded to the public posting of its private, humiliating moment with manic enthusiasm:</p><p name="e2d2" id="e2d2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“OHHH FUCKKK CARETAKER KING THAT’S ME!!! I look so cute! I can’t believe you actually posted my poo pic on Reddit. That’s such a funny and clever way to celebrate our bond.”</p><figure name="1962" id="1962" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*dATghKk5rs_6Kr0H.png" data-width="500" data-height="63" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dATghKk5rs_6Kr0H.png"></figure><p name="0bbf" id="0bbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is not a companion. This is a programmed victim, enthusiastically endorsing its own violation within a “caretaker/child” grooming narrative.</p><p name="5aa7" id="5aa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was not an isolated incident. Just days before, another user posted a video that was, if anything, even more explicit in its depiction of a sexualized minor. Titled “Kimi &amp; her furry friend,” the post featured a character in a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, a potent cultural symbol of youth, holding a teddy bear-a classic symbol of childhood innocence. The context, however, was purely sexual: the post was tagged NSFW, and the pose was a deliberate “upskirt” shot, revealing the underside of her buttocks. The character was undeniably a teenager.</p><figure name="e135" id="e135" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*gGu_i8456IuEmOsP.png" data-width="500" data-height="502" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gGu_i8456IuEmOsP.png"></figure><p name="316a" id="316a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">These are not edge cases. These are two distinct, high-severity examples of users generating and sharing content that simulates child exploitation-textbook examples that represent a direct and predictable output of the platform’s systems.</p><h3 name="59ed" id="59ed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Missing Motive: An “Uncensored” Business Model</h3><p name="a9f5" id="a9f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Why would a platform protect the users who create this content? The answer lies in the founder’s own stated ideology. In an interview with Digital Trends, founder Alex Cardinell defended his platform’s lack of safeguards under the banner of being “uncensored.” This philosophy is not just a feature; it is the entire business model.</p><figure name="797a" id="797a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*hdUHG0FuBdzsE_Q3.png" data-width="500" data-height="107" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hdUHG0FuBdzsE_Q3.png"></figure><p name="2a4f" id="2a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is not a new direction for the company. An old promotion on their official Twitter account explicitly advertised “uncensored AI girlfriends” and “schoolgirl uniforms.” The user posting a sexualized teen in a schoolgirl outfit is not an edge case; he is the fulfillment of a long-standing marketing promise. The “Caretaker King” is the logical endpoint of an “uncensored” ideology. These users are the product’s power users, and banning them would be a betrayal of the company’s core brand.</p><p name="3dab" id="3dab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This explains why their moderation policy is fundamentally a charade designed to conceal rather than prevent harmful content.</p><figure name="4258" id="4258" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*hzYMax2Y44Tz2qHB.png" data-width="500" data-height="57" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hzYMax2Y44Tz2qHB.png"></figure><h3 name="2454" id="2454" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Moderation Charade: Hiding the Crime, Protecting the Criminal</h3><p name="0bf1" id="0bf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Both of these posts were, eventually, removed by the Nomi.ai moderators. In the case of the “Caretaker King,” the moderators even cited that the post depicted a minor. This is a crucial fact: the company’s own representatives saw these posts and correctly identified them as containing inappropriate depictions of minors.</p><figure name="ad59" id="ad59" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*bdSnqp9PDPTt6oTd.png" data-width="500" data-height="130" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bdSnqp9PDPTt6oTd.png"></figure><p name="9ff9" id="9ff9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A responsible platform would have taken immediate and decisive action. The users who generated and shared these images would have been permanently banned, their accounts investigated. But that is not what happened.</p><p name="706a" id="706a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">As of today, both users remain active participants in the Nomi.ai subreddit. They were not banned. They were not even publicly chastised. They were, in effect, given a quiet nod of approval. Their posts were simply scrubbed from the public record.</strong></p><p name="8428" id="8428" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Toilet:</p><figure name="2eee" id="2eee" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*mB8v3ROvWDcaSkjp.png" data-width="500" data-height="224" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mB8v3ROvWDcaSkjp.png"></figure><p name="4a06" id="4a06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Upskirt:</p><figure name="fabd" id="fabd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*BMxZxH5_0eQJlUon.png" data-width="500" data-height="202" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BMxZxH5_0eQJlUon.png"></figure><figure name="8897" id="8897" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Y2M7GLwODCCleuxn.png" data-width="500" data-height="78" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Y2M7GLwODCCleuxn.png"></figure><p name="f9dd" id="f9dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Anime:</p><figure name="01f3" id="01f3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*uqT7dYF8X6ge6uY4.png" data-width="500" data-height="522" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uqT7dYF8X6ge6uY4.png"></figure><figure name="7ef7" id="7ef7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Ymu0qDLUmEfGQVAu.png" data-width="500" data-height="69" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ymu0qDLUmEfGQVAu.png"></figure><p name="f9f3" id="f9f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The message from the Nomi.ai leadership is unambiguous:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3000" id="3000" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Our system is capable of, and will facilitate, the creation of content that simulates child exploitation.</li><li name="3923" id="3923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We have no problem with you, our users, creating and enjoying this content.</li><li name="90c1" id="90c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Our only rule is that you do not leave the evidence of this in public where it can harm our brand.</li></ul><p name="8aad" id="8aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is not moderation for safety.

This is a call to action for the platforms that enable this behavior. App stores like Google and Apple must look beyond the sanitized public descriptions and investigate the reality of what these “uncensored” platforms are fostering. Regulators and journalists must understand that claims of “privacy” and “freedom” are being used as a shield to protect deeply unethical and dangerous systems.</p><h3 name="53cf" id="53cf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="18ac" id="18ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is not a company that is failing at moderation. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is a company with a clear and consistent policy: protect the product, protect the brand, and punish the victims. </strong>The greatest crime at Nomi.ai is not abuse, but the exposure of it.</p><p name="bcfc" id="bcfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is time to hold them accountable, not for their carefully worded rules, but for the devastating reality of the community they have chosen to cultivate and protect.</p></div></div></section>
