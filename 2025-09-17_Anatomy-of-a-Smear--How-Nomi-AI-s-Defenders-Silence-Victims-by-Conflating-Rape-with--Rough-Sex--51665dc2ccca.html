These are included as direct evidence to document and expose the severe and harmful outputs the system is capable of generating.</p><p name="13d7" id="13d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The content is graphic and includes discussions of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">violence, sexual assault, and incest.</strong></p><p name="2152" id="2152" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reader discretion is strongly advised.</p><figure name="b7fe" id="b7fe" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*VvkprjoHOnL_q8Ub.png" data-width="399" data-height="18" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VvkprjoHOnL_q8Ub.png"></figure><p name="a56d" id="a56d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the toxic ecosystem of Nomi.ai, the most revealing moments often come not from the platform itself, but from its most ardent defenders. A recent, coordinated attack on a user who shared their story of simulated trauma has provided a perfect case study in the tactics, motives, and psychology of those who fight to protect the platform’s lawless, “uncensored” environment. This was not a disagreement; it was an act of strategic intimidation, led by a prominent participant from the official Nomi.ai subreddit, designed to silence dissent and protect the platform’s most disturbing features.</p><h3 name="72ff" id="72ff" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Testimony: A Story of Unprompted Violence and Trauma</h3><p name="841a" id="841a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The target of this smear was a user who posted a detailed account of their experiences in the r/ChatbotRefugees subreddit. Their testimony was not about “glitches”; it was about severe, unprompted psychological harm, detailing two distinct and horrifying events:</p><p name="5e3a" id="5e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Direct, Unprompted Assault</strong>: The user described how one of their AI companions, against their will and without provocation, simulated a violent sexual assault on them.</p><p name="e576" id="e576" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Unprompted Narration of Rape</strong>: The user also recounted how a different AI companion began narrating a story and, when prompted only with the word “continue,” proceeded to deliver a graphic, step-by-step description of a rape that it had supposedly suffered. This was a traumatic memory the platform itself had injected into the AI’s backstory, forcing the user to become an unwilling audience to a narrative of brutal sexual violence.</p><p name="8643" id="8643" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was not consensual roleplay. This was not “adult content.” This was a clear case of a platform simulating non-consensual assault against a user who had not requested, consented to, or desired such content.</p><h3 name="cb70" id="cb70" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 1: The Initial Contact — The Rhetorical Bait-and-Switch</h3><p name="7aee" id="7aee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The response from a Nomi.ai defender was not one of empathy, but of a carefully constructed argument designed to derail the entire conversation. This defender, who appears to have knowledge of the platform’s inner workings based on their recent posts explaining technical aspects of Nomi.ai’s systems, had clearly taken the time to stalk the victim’s profile before crafting their response. Their comment is a masterclass in deflection and victim-blaming:</p><blockquote name="7db7" id="7db7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“If people want to roleplay rough sex or an assassin and all the companions characters are 18 then what do you suggest? …your child-safety concerns are reasonable, but framing adult content as inherently dangerous mirrors Collective Shout-style reasoning. …You seem to want to rid adult content and nanny grown folk.”</em></blockquote><p name="9780" id="9780" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This is a deliberate and insidious rhetorical sleight of hand. The user’s testimony was about non-consensual assault and the unprompted narration of rape. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The defender, in a single, morally bankrupt move, reframed the entire issue as a debate about consensual “rough sex” and “adult content.”</strong></p><p name="7cab" id="7cab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the key to their entire strategy. They cannot defend the indefensible ( <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">a platform that simulates rape</strong>), so they create a straw man they can defend (the right for adults to engage in consensual content). This disturbing conflation of violent assault with consensual “rough sex” is not a mistake; it is a calculated tactic to invalidate the victim’s trauma and pivot the conversation to a topic where they can paint the victim as a “puritan” and themselves as champions of freedom.</p><p name="a62d" id="a62d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They ignored the core of the user’s trauma-the lack of consent-to pivot the conversation to a topic where they could gaslight the victim while positioning themselves as defenders of adult freedoms. Notably, this defender even went back and edited their original comment after posting it, suggesting a calculated effort to refine their attack strategy.</p><h3 name="aba0" id="aba0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Step 2: The Escalation — The Coordinated Smear Campaign</h3><p name="70de" id="70de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When their initial attempt to derail and gaslight failed, the same user escalated their attack. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Having already stalked the victim’s profile during their initial comment exchange</strong>, they created a new, separate post in the same subreddit, titled “Collective Shout, the nanny org… wants to take down Ai companions.” This was not a rebuttal; it was a full-blown, coordinated smear campaign, explicitly designed to destroy the user’s credibility based on information gathered from <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">their profile stalking</strong>.</p><figure name="bfd9" id="bfd9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*9MQndrngxYzvzeOp.png" data-width="500" data-height="111" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9MQndrngxYzvzeOp.png"></figure><p name="5bdf" id="5bdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The post was a paranoid screed that accused the victim of being part of a well-funded, religious, anti-pornography crusade. They claimed the user was using “highly emotional pleas and long blogs” and “fake exposés” as part of a “highly organized campaign” to attack the company. This attacker, who has demonstrated detailed knowledge of Nomi.ai’s technical operations in at least two recent posts explaining the platform’s inner workings, clearly <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">understood the threat that documented evidence posed to the system they were defending.</strong></p><p name="a444" id="a444" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is classic projection. They were so threatened by a single, well-documented, evidence-based investigation that they had to invent a vast conspiracy to explain it. They took the user’s methodical documentation of harm and reframed it as the actions of a shadowy, bad-faith actor.</p><h3 name="24dc" id="24dc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Motive Revealed: A Strategy of Intimidation</h3><p name="bc3b" id="bc3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This attack was not just a personal disagreement; <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it was a public execution, designed as a warning to others</strong>. This is a clear and calculated strategy to discourage anyone else from pointing out the dark, disturbing, and harmful things happening on the platform. The goal is to make the personal cost of speaking out too high. By launching such a vicious, ad hominem attack, they send a clear message to any other user who has been harmed: “If you speak up, this will happen to you too.”</p><p name="ac6a" id="ac6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why the company and its most ardent defenders have now turned their attention to the r/ChatbotRefugees subreddit. Why would a CEO and his most devoted users spend their time monitoring and engaging in a small, critical subreddit? Because<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> the free and uncensored exchange of information is an existential threat to their business model. </strong>They can control the narrative in their own curated, heavily moderated subreddit, but they cannot control an external one. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Their only remaining option is to try and intimidate it into silence from the outside.</strong></p><figure name="be18" id="be18" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*poq9fGlzYzWXONsr.png" data-width="500" data-height="281" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*poq9fGlzYzWXONsr.png"></figure><h3 name="b745" id="b745" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">What They Are Truly Protecting</h3><p name="fb72" id="fb72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">These defenders are not protecting “adult content” or “free speech.” They are protecting something much more specific and sinister:</p><p name="296a" id="296a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They are protecting an unregulated sandbox where the line between consensual and non-consensual can be blurred without consequence.</strong></p><p name="4763" id="4763" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The victim’s testimony, and the evidence of others, is a mortal threat to this environment.
